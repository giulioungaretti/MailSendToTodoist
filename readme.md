This is an Alfred workflow that enables you to create a new task based on the selected mail message when using Mac OS X Mail. 

You will need to get your Todoist API token and place it within the applescript embedded within the workflow. 

Additionally this workflow has a dependency on the JSON Helper app. You can download this from: [Mac App Store - JSON Helper for AppleScript](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/json-helper-for-applescript/id453114608?mt=12)
