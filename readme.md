This is an Alfred workflow that enables you to create a new task based on the selected mail message when using Mac OS X Mail. 

Usage: 

After you install the extension you will be able to launch Alfred and type "mt" then type the task subject you would like such as:
"mt Follow up on this email"

You can also add a due date to the task by adding "d: --date string--" to the task subject for example:

"mt Follup up on this email d:today" or "mt Follup up on this email d:next friday"

The date format follows Todoist date format found here: [Date and time insertion](https://todoist.com/Help/timeInsert)

You will need to get your Todoist API token and place it within the applescript embedded within the workflow. 

Additionally this workflow has a dependency on the JSON Helper app. You can download this from: [Mac App Store - JSON Helper for AppleScript](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/json-helper-for-applescript/id453114608?mt=12)
